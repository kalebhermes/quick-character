#### Deal with Heretics
Combat, Small Church

A small collection of people have put up a "church" in the South Ward that's teaching the word of "Lathander". These people have a twisted view of The Morning Lord and are driving people away from his holy word. The must be stopped, by force if necessary. Convince them to stop their heretical preaching by any means necessary. Obviously outward aggression isn't ideal, Lathander is a just god, but this insanity cannot stand.

These men worship Yat-zee, an unholy god, and mortal enemy to Lathander. They're impersonating Lathander worshipers, commiting missdeeds. If they're able to convert people to the worship of "Lathander", they've done their job. And if not, they'll at least drive those who don't know any better away from the real Lathander's holy radiance.

#### Find Xanathar Guild Wererat Speakeasy
Combat, Speakeasy

Mirt informs the group that a scurry of Wererat have a speakeasy that's used by the Xanathar Guild to traffic guild supplies. That needs to stop, and if a Wererat infestation was wiped out in the process, who's going to complain?

A box of magic items destined for the Harpers has been stolen from one of our agents. A member of the Xanathar's Guild is here tonight, and we have information that he's headed to check on the goods after leaving here. Follow him, find the speakeasy, clear them out and get our stuff back.

Once you have the crate, bring it back to Trollskull Manor, I'll wait for you there. Make sure you're not followed.
