#### Horus "Windwalker" Olavi

Real name is Horaxio. 

**What is your secret purpose for joining the group?**

 12 years prior Horus was a herder in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. His home was overrun by bandits who murdered his wife and abducted his 3 year old daughter. After this loss, he joined the monastery. Not long before the start of the campaign, Jalester Silvermane sent a letter to Horus alleging that one of the masked lords of Waterdeep was responsible for the abduction. Horus came to Waterdeep to find the lord and exact revenge.

**Who have you wronged?**
